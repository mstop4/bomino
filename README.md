# Bomino

***Bomino*** **is a modernized version of a classic, explosive falling block puzzle game, with features and improvements inspired by newer falling block games.**

Arrange and place the pieces, made up of minos and bombs, as the fall into the well. When a entire horizontal line is filled, any bombs in that row will explode, clearing neighbouring minos. The more lines that are filled in at once, the bigger the explosions. Arrange four bombs in a square shape and watch them merge into a big bomb with high explosive power.
